 - The goal of this project was to implement 
   memory allocation, threads and synchronization.
 - Part of the job was to also provide users with a C++ API 
   which they can use to create and synchronize their own processes.
 
 - All files inside 'h' and 'src' directories are part of the written kernel.
 - The 'hw' file in the lib folder was necessary for emulating 
   the operating system's hardware.
 - The files 'mem' and 'console' in the lib folder represent premade API 
   which we used for testing before creating our own API.
 - Contents of the 'test' directory were prewritten and given to us in advance.
